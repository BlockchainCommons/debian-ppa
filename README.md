# Blockchain Commons `ppa-debian`


### _by [Gorazd Kovacic](https://www.github.com/gorazdko) and [Christopher Allen](https://www.github.com/ChristopherA)_

This repo holds debian packages of various Blockchain Commons tools:
* seedtool
* keytool

See [packages](debian/Packages) for more details.


## Status - Late Alpha

` ppa-debian`  is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.


## Prerequisites

Debian based Linux OS (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Tails), gpg and a gpg keypair

## Instructions

To publish a new debian package (.deb) a maintainer has to:
* create a debian package and push it into this repo
* sign the PPA
* test installing a package on a local machine

### Creating a debian package


Decide on the name of your project in accordance with [[source](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=910717)]

```bash
<project>_<major version>.<minor version>.<package revision>
```

For example:

```bash
helloworld_1.0.1
```

Create a directory with the following structure:

```bash
$ mkdir helloworld_1.0.1
$ mkdir helloworld_1.0.1/usr
$ mkdir helloworld_1.0.1/usr/local
$ mkdir helloworld_1.0.1/usr/local/bin
```

Follow the build instructions of a particular tool that you want to package.
After the executable is generated, copy paste it into `helloworld_1.0.1/usr/local/bin`

Noe create the file `control`:

```bash
mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN
gedit helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN/control
```

with the following content:

```bash
Package: helloworld
Version: 1.0.1
Section: base
Priority: optional
Architecture: all
Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)
Maintainer: Your Name <you@email.com>
Description: Hello World
 When you need some sunshine, just run this
 small program!
```

Finally, create the package with:

```bash
dpkg-deb --build helloworld_1.0.1
```

Copy paste the generated package `helloworld_1.0.1.deb` into this repo into `debian/`

### Sign the PPA

Execute the script in the root of the project:

```bash
$ ./update.sh
```

*Note:* Maintainer has to set his fingerprint of his `gpg` key in the `update.sh`, e.g.

```bash
KEYNAME=41F0EA1699A74C1E2FA41B538CF96BC3FF9DBBCE
```

and export his public key to the root of this repo:

```bash
key gpg --armor --export "${EMAIL or fingerprint of the key}" > KEY.gpg
```

### Test

Execute these 3 steps to add a gpg key and a ppa to your local database:

```bash
$ wget -O - -o /dev/null  "https://BlockchainCommons.github.io/debian-ppa/KEY.gpg" | sudo apt-key add -
$ wget -O - -o /dev/null  "https://BlockchainCommons.github.io/debian-ppa/debian/BlockchainCommons.list" | sudo tee -a  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/BlockchainCommons.list
$ sudo apt-get update
```

> Note, on Tails OS the second step is:

```bash
$ wget -O - -o /dev/null  "https://BlockchainCommons.github.io/debian-ppa/debian/BlockchainCommons.list" | sed -e "s/https/tor+http/g" | sudo tee -a  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/BlockchainCommons.list
```

Finally, you can install a Blockchain Commons package:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install package-name
```

where package-name can be:
* seedtool-cli
* keytool-cli

It is recommended to check if the program works and if the version is correctly bumped.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
